# Client Dashboard Page Overview

The Client Dashboard is designed for users who need home services. It provides a central place to manage service requests, track technicians, and monitor service history. Here's a breakdown of each component:

## Main Layout Structure
- The page uses a responsive grid system that adapts to different screen sizes
- Dark blue color scheme (`#23486A`, `#3B6790`) with accent colors (`#EFB036`, `#4C7B8B`)
- Two-column layout with main content on the left and sidebar on the right

## Header Section
- Profile image and client information (name and rating)
- Total spent amount displayed prominently
- Quick access buttons for notifications and settings

## Navigation Tabs
- Horizontal tabs for quick switching between dashboard sections:
  - Dashboard (main overview)
  - My Services (active services)
  - My Technicians (assigned professionals)
  - Service History (past services)

## Service Providers Section
- Grid of cards showing assigned technicians
- Each card includes:
  - Technician photo and name
  - Area of expertise (Plumbing, Electric, etc.)
  - Current status (Currently Working, Scheduled, etc.)
  - Action buttons to contact or view details

## Activity Log Section
- Chronological list of recent service-related activities
- Includes completed repairs, scheduled appointments, feedback submissions
- Shows payment information for each activity

## Service Status Summary
- Three status cards showing at-a-glance metrics:
  - Active Services count
  - Completed Services count
  - Total Spent amount
- Each card has a distinct icon and color for visual identification

## Navigation Menu (Sidebar)
- Vertical menu with icon-based navigation
- Options include:
  - Dashboard
  - My Services
  - Appointments
  - Messages
  - Service Requests

## Upcoming Services Widget
- List of scheduled service appointments
- Each card shows:
  - Service type (e.g., Bathroom Sink Repair)
  - Date and time
  - Assigned technician
  - Status (Confirmed/Pending)
  - Address
- Color-coded status indicators (green for confirmed, yellow for pending)

## Quick Actions

The entire interface uses React with Next.js's App Router, featuring client-side components (marked with "use client" directive) that can use React hooks like `useState` for interactivity. The design follows a consistent color scheme and component style for a cohesive user experience.
  






I've successfully created all the necessary pages for the client dashboard routing system:
Dashboard Page (/client and /client/dashboard)
Main client dashboard showing an overview of services, providers, and activities
Shows all main sections from the original ClientDashboardPage component
Services Page (/client/services)
Lists all services (active, scheduled, completed)
Shows detailed information about each service
Allows filtering by status
Includes actions for each service
Technicians Page (/client/technicians)
Shows all service providers/technicians
Includes search and filter functionality
Displays detailed information for each technician
Provides actions to schedule, message, or call technicians
Appointments Page (/client/appointments)
Lists all appointments (upcoming, past, cancelled)
Shows detailed information for each appointment
Provides appropriate actions based on appointment status
Allows scheduling new appointments
Messages Page (/client/messages)
Full-featured messaging interface
Lists all contacts with technicians
Shows conversation history
Supports sending new messages
Accepts URL parameters to open specific conversations
All pages follow a consistent design style matching the client dashboard:
Dark blue background (#23486A)
Lighter blue for cards (#3B6790)
Accent colors for highlights (#EFB036 for primary actions)
Clear typography with appropriate hierarchy
Responsive layouts that work on both mobile and desktop
Each page includes "use client" directive for Next.js App Router and imports the necessary components. They all connect through the routing system we implemented in the ClientDashboardPage component.
